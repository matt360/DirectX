Shrinking the pixel sizes by incerasing the monitor resolution can 
allevaite the
problem significantly to where the stair-step effect goes largly unnoticed.
When increasing the monitor resolution is not possible or not enough, 
we can apply antialiasing techniques. One technique, called supersampling,
works by making the back buffer and depth buffer 4X bigger than the screen
resolution. The 3D scene is then rendered to the back buffer at this larger 
resolution. Then, when it comes time to present the back buffer to the screen,
the back buffer is resolved (or downsampled) such that 4 pixel block colours
are averaged together to get an averaged pixel colour. In effect, supersampling
works by increasing the resolution in software.

Supersampling is expensive becasue it increases the amount of pixel processing
and memory by fourfold. Direct3D supports a compromising antialiasing
technique called multisampling, which shares some computational information
across subpixels making it less expensive than supersampling. Assuming we are
using 4X multisampling (4 subpixels per pixel), multisampling also uses
a back buffer and depth buffer 4X bigger than the screen resolution;
however, instead of computing the image colour for each subpixel, it computes
it only once per pixel, at the pixel center, and then shares that colour 
information with its subpixels based on visibilty (the depth/stencil test
is evaluated per subpixel) and coverage (does the subpixel center lie inside
or outside the polygon?).

Observe the key difference between supersampling and multisampling.
With supersamplign, the image colour is computed per subpixel, and so
each subpixel could potentially be a different colour. With multisampling,
(Figure 4.5) the image colour is computed once per pixel and that colour
is replicated into all visible subpixels that are covered by the polygon.
Because computing the image colour is one of the most expensive steps in the
graphics pipeline, the savings from multisampling over supersampling is
siginificant. On the othe hand, supersampling is technically more accurate and
handels texture and shader aliasing, which multisampling does not.

in Figure 4.5, we show a pixel subdivided into four subpixels in a uniform 
grid pattern. The actual pattern used (the points where the subpixels are
positioned) can vary across hardware vendors, as Direct3D does not define the
placement of the subpixels. Some patterns do better than others in certain
situations.
