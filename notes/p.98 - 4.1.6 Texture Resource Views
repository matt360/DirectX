A texture can be bound to different stages of the rendering pipeline;
a common example is to use a texture as a render target (i.e., Direct3D
draws into the texture) and as a shader resource (i.e., the texture
will be sampled in a shader). A texture resource created for those two
purposes would be given the bind flags:
D3D11_BIND_RENDER_TARGET | D3D11_BIND_SHADER_RESOURCE
indicating the two pipeline stages the texture will be bound to.
Actaually, resources are not directly bound to a pipeline stage;
instead their associated resource views are bound to different pipeline stages.
