for (uint i = 10; i > param; i--) if param is smaller than 10 the loop will not have an ending condition. 
Also i is an unsigned integer which will crash the program if param is smaller than 10 because once param is smaller than 0
unsigned int will roll back to the beginning which will be around 65k for 2byte storage size or
 about 4bilion for 4byte number (4,294,967,295)
if param is bigger than 10 - the loop will no execute.

float x;
float y;

y = pObject->myFloat + x * i; 
adding x - uninitialized variable. Will cause unexpected behaviour.
multiplying a float by an unsigned integer - will cause loss of precision and
will produce a warning about converting unsigned integer to float.

return y
the function is expected to return an integer and y is a float -
will cause an error.
